##Files
1.  Initial_data.png 
Contains the initial visualization of data. Data taken with only two dimensions.

2.  pca_components.png
PC1 in the figure shows the direction of the most variation in data. Since we have only two dimensions the second line/ PC2 is just a perpendicular to PC1 but would otherwise show the second most direction of variation.

3.  pca_output.txt
File gives all the step wise outputs required, new points towards the end are the new coordinates with reduced dimensions.
